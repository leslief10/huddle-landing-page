## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Finding the exact same icons as the ones in the desgin can be a bit hard. I learned that with the fill property you can modify the color of an svg.

### Continued development

Nothing specific to add at this time :)

### Useful resources

- [CSS filter generator to convert from black to target hex color](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This helped me modify the svg's color with the filter property.
